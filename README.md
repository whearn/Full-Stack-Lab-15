## Due: Wednesday, June 21st, 09:00
##### Covalence
###### Full Stack: Summer 2017

## Submission Instructions
* Simply make sure you commit to your repositories and push before the lab is due

## Objectives
### Create a MySQL Database for Chirper
* In Terminal, make sure your working directory is this project folder
* Make sure your MySQL server is running
* Log in to the MySQL command line utility as root
* Create a database called Chirper
* Create a new user with all permissions for database Chirper
* Quit the MySQL prompt and log back in with the new user
* Create a table to represent a chirp (Remember the naming conventions!)
    * Chirps should have a property called id that is an integer and is automatically created by the database
    * Chirps have a message property with a maximum character length of 140 characters
    * Chirps have a user property with a maximum character length of 20 characters
    * Chirps have a timestamp property with datatype of datetime
* Using the MySQL command line interface, add some chirps, edit some chirps, and delete some chirps from your table
* When you are finished, you should have 10 chirps in the table
* To get credit for this assignment, you need to export your database and its data to a .sql file and put it in this repository
* To do that, you will use `mysqldump`
* `mysqldump` is a utility provided by MySQL that will take your database structure and contents and write them out to a .sql file
* To run it, make sure your working directory is this repository and then use:
```
mysqldump -u databaseUser -p Chirper > chirper.sql
```
The format is: mysqldump -u userToLoginAs -p NameOfDatabaseToExport > outputFileName.sql

* NOTE: If you did not update your path to where you can just run `mysql`, you will also need to put the full path for `mysqldump`:
```
/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqldump -u databaseUser -p Chirper > chirper.sql
```
